A WARRIOR so bold and a virgin so bright
Conversed as they sat on, the green 3

They gazed on each other with tender delight‚

Alonzo the Brave was the name of the knight,

The maid’s was the Fair Imogine.

‘⁶ And, oh 1 '⁹ said the youth, ‘⁶ since to-morrow I go
To fight in a far distant land,
Your tears for my absence soon oeasing to fiow,
Some other will oourt yOU‚ and you will bestow

On a wealthier suitor your hand.”

“‘Oh1 hush these suspicions,” Fair Imogine said,
‘⁶ Offensive to love and to me 1
For if you be living, or if you be dead,

I swear by the Virgin, that none in your stead
Shall husband of Imogine be.

‘⁶ And if e'er for another my heart should decide,
Forgetting Alonzo the Brave,
God grant, that, to punish my falsehood and pride,
Your ghost at the marriage may sit by my side,
May tax me with perjury, claim me as bride,

And bear me away to the grave 1²²
