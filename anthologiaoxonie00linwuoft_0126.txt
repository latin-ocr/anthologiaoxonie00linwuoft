ANTHOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

 

LIX.

OEhz {alez uf &tutta

THE isles of Greece, the isles of Greecel
Where burning Sappho loved and sung,

Where grew the arts of war and peace,
VVhere Delos rose, and Phoebus sprung!

Eternal summer gilds them yet3

But all, except their sun, is set.

The mountains look on Marathon,
And Marathon looks on the sea3
And musing there an hour alone,
I dreamed that Greece might still be free ς
For, standing on the Persians’ grave,
I could not deem myself a slave.

A king sate on the rocky brow
Which looks o'er sea-born Salamis3
And ships by thousands lay below,
And men in nations, —- all were his!
He counted them at break of day —
And when the sun set where were they?

And where are they ⁴? and where art thou,
My country? On thy voiceless shore

The heroic lay is tuneless now —-
The heroic bosom beats no more 1

And must thy lyre, so long divine,
Degenerate into hands like mine?
