LXXIX.

Qumiral {aazias &host ,

AS near Porto-Bello lying
On the gently swelling flood,

At midnight With streamers flying
Our triumphant navy rode 3

There, while Vernon sate all-glorious,
From the Spaniards’ late defeat 3

And his ereWS, with shouts victorious,
Drank success to England’s fieet 3

On a sudden shrilly sounding,
Hideous yells and shrieks were heard3
Then each heart with fear eonfounding,
A sad troop of ghosts appeared,
All in dreary hammoeks shrouded, ,-
Which for winding-sheets they wore,
And with looks by sorrow clouded
Frowning on that hostile shore.

On them* gleamed the moon’s wan lustre,
When the shade of Hosier brave

His pale bands was seen to muster
Rising from their wat’ry grave.

- O'er the glimmering wave he hyed him,

Where the Burford reared her sail,
With three thousand ghosts beside him,
And in groans did Vernon hail.
