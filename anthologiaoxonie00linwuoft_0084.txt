To some enehanted eastle is eonveyed‚
Where gates impregnable, and eoereive chaine,
In duranee striet detain him ς ’till, in form

Of money, Pallas sets the captive free. ¹

THE Redbreast, sacred to the household godS‚
Wisely regardful of the embroiling sky,

In joyless fields and thorny thiekets leaves

His shjvering mates, and pays to trusted man

His annual visit. Half-afraid, he first

Against the Window beats3 then, brisk, alights
On the warm hearth3 then, hopping o’er the floor,
Eyes all the smiling family askanee‚

And peekS‚ and startS, and wonders where he is3
T ill, more familiar grown, the table erumbs

Attraet his slender feet.
