He called me by my name,
As the bride of another:
Oh ! thou hast been the cause
Of this anguish, my mother 1

    

    

And once again we met 3
And a fair girl was near him:
He smiled‚ and whispered low,

As I onoe used to hear him.

She leaned upon his arm 3

Once ’t was mine, and mine only:
I wept3 for I deserved

To feel wretched and lonely.

And she will be his bride 1
At 'the altar he ²11 give her
The love that was too pure

For a heartless deceiver.

 

The world may think me gay 3
For my feelings I smother ε

Α11 l thou hast beeh³the cause
Of this anguirsh, my mother 1
