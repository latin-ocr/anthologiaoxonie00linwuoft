OEu a 'ssaha

Is but a barbarous skill 3

’Tis but the poisoning of the dart
Too apt before to kill.

AS when a shepherd of the Hebrid isles,

Plaoed far amid the melancholy main,
(Whether it be lone fancy him beguiles 3
Or that aeria] beings sometimes deign

To stand embodied, to our senses plain,)
Sees on the naked hill, or valley low,

The whilst in ocean Phoebus dips his wain,
A vast assembly moving to and fro ε

Then‚ all at once, in air dissolves the wondrous show.
