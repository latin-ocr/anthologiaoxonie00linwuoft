*There are a thousand joyous things in life

 

ANTIIOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

XLIV.

OEbe 33⁰2 uf &titt

ION. CLEMANTHE.

Ion. No, thou must live, my fair one.

Which pass unheeded in a life of joy,

As thine hath been, till breezy sorrow eomes
To ruffle it 3 and. daily duties paid

Hardly at first, at length will bring repose
To the sad mind that studies to perform them.

 

Thou dost not mark me.
Clem. Oh, I do! I do!
Ion. If for thy brother’s and thy father's sake
Thou art content to live, the healer Time
Will reeoneile thee to the lovely things

Of this delightful world.

Talfourd.

XLV.

OEbe OEtaheller.

REMOTE, unfriended, melancholy, slow‚

Or by the lazy Scheldt or wandering Po,
Where'er I roam, whatever realms to see,
My heart, untravelled, fondly turns to thee,
Still to my brother turns with ceaseless pain,

And drags at eaeh remove a lengthening chain.
Goldsmith.
