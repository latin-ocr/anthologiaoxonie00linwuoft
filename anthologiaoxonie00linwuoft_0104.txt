T ΗΕ rose had been washed‚ just washed in a shower,
Which Mary to Anna conveyed 3
The plentiful moisture encumbered the flower,

And weighed down its beautiful head.

The cup was all filled, and the leaves were all wet3
And it seemed to a fanoiful view,

To weep for the buds it had left with regret
On the flourishing bush where it, grew.

I hastily seized it, unfit as it was

For a nosegay, so dripping and drowned3
And swinging it rudely, too rudely, alas Σ

Ι snapped it, it fell to the ground.

‘⁶ And suob,” I exolaimed, ‘⁶ is the pitiless part

Some aot by the delicate mind,
Regardless of wringing and breaking a heart
Already to sorrow resigned.

“ This elegant rose, had I shaken it less, ›

Might have bloomed with its owner awhile 3
And the tear, that is wiped with a little addreSS,
May be followed perhaps by a smile.‘’
