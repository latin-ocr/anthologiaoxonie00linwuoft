XCV.
&nohttusihe Qeauty.

AS lamps burn silent with unconseious light,
So modest ease in beauty shines most bright:
Unaiming eharms with edge resistless fall,

And she, who meant no mischief‚ does it all.

XCVI.

LIKE to the falling of a star,

Or as the ‘ssights of eagles are3

Or like the fresh spring’s gaudy hue,
Or silver drops of morning dew 3

Or like a wind that ehafes the flood,
Or bubbles which on water stood 3

E'en such is man, whose borrowed light
Is straight called in and paid to-night.
The wind blows out, the bubble dies;
The spring entombed in autumn lies;
The dew dries up, the star is shot3 f
The ssight is' past, and man forgot.
