XLVI.

ΙΤ was the spring, and newly risen day
Peeped o’er the hamlets on the first of May3
My eyeS, too tender for the blaze of light,
Still sought the 81101101· of retiring night,
’ When Love approaehed in painted plumes arrayed‚
The insidious god 1118 rattling darts betrayed,
Nor 1088 1118 infant featureS, and the sly
Sweet intimatione of his threatening eye.

 

Such the Sigean boy is seen above

Filling the goblet for imperial Jove 3

Such he on whom the Nymphs bestowed their charmS,
Hylas, who perished in a N aiad's arms:

Angry he seemed, yet graeeful in his ire,

And added threats‚ 1101 destitute of fire. ἱ

ΟΟΜΕ, Leila, fill the goblet up,
Reaeh round 1110 rosy wine:

Think not that we will take the cup
From any hand but 1111110.

Α 'draught like this ’t were vain 10 seek3
No grape ean 811011 supply3

It steals its 111118 from Leila's oheek,

Its brightness from her eye.

XLVII.
Ἕω a female Quupbearer.
