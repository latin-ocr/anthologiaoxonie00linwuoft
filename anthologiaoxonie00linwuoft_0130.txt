OEhe Qeugat’ Β {Batinum

P1TY the sorrows of a poor old man,
Whose trembling limbs have borne him to your door3
Whose days are dwindled to the shortest span:

Oh! give relief, and Heaven will bless your store.

Hard ls the fate of the infirm and poor!
Here, as I begged a morsel of their bread,
A pampered menial drove me from their door,

To seek a shelter 111 an humbler shed.

A little farm was my paternal lot3
Then, like the lark, I sprightly hailed the morn3
But, ah! oppression forced me from my σοῖς

My cattle died, and blighted was my corn.
