ANTHOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

It is a dial — which points out
The sunset as it moves about ε
And shadows out in lines of night
The subtle stages of Time's ssight,
Till all-obseuring earth hath laid
His body in perpetual shade.

It is a weary interlude — Ι
Which doth short joyS‚ long woes include:
The world the stage, the prologue tears;
The aots vain hopes and varied fears 3 ι
The soene shuts up with loss of breath,

And leaves no epilogue but Death 1

LXXXIX.

{Epitapb un a n2m=hot11 ssusam.

ERE sin could blight, or sorrow fade,
Death eame with friendly oare3

The opening bud to heaven oonveyed,
And bade it blossom there.
