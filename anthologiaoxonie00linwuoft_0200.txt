‘⁶ Behold me, thou false one! behold me! ” he eried 3
“ Remember Alonzo the Brave!
God grantS‚ that, to punish thy falsehood and pride,
My ghost at thy marriage should sit by· thy side,
Should tax thee with perjury, claim thee as bride,
And bear thee away to the grave 1 ”

ι Thus saying, his arms round the lady he wound,
ξ while loudly she shrieked in dismay ;
⁵ Then sank with his pre& through the wide-yawning

ground ε

Nor ever again was Fair Imogine found,

Or the speotre who bore her away.

To inhabit the oastle presume 3
For chronioles tell, that, by order sublime,
There Imogine suffers the pain of her crime,

And mourns her deplorable doom.

At midnight four times in eaeh year does her sprite,

η
Not long lived the Baron: and none since that time
Ι When mortale in slumber are bound,

Arrayed in her bridal apparel of white,
Appear in the hall with the skeleton-knight‚ v

Andlshriek as he whirls her around.
