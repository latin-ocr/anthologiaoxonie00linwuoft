 

Ι 72 ANTHOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

Yet, prophet-like, the lone one stood,
With dauntless words and high, ἱ

That shook the sear leaves from the wood,

 

As if a storm passed by 3
Saying, “ We are twins in death, proud Sun,
Thy face is cold, thy raee is run,

’T is Merey bids thee go 3
For thou ten thousand thousand years

Hast seen the tide of human tearS,

 

That shall no longer flow.

“ This spirit shall return to Him
That gave its heavenly spark 3
Yet think not, Sun, it shall be dim
When thou thyself art dark.

No 1 it shall live again, and shine

In bliss unknown to beams of ι thine 3
By, Him recalled to breath,

Who captive led captivity,

Who robbed the grave of victory,
Andtook the sting from Death.
