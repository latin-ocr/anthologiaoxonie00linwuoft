ΒΥ THE SAME.
FOUNTAIN of health! and hope! and saith and life!

That quell’st my tortured bosom’s restless strife3

l

And to relieve my agonizing dreams 1
Pour’st forth thy crystal, eool, bright, salient streames· Ι
Under the hand of classic Chambers placed, ι
ΓΑ new Castalia freshens to my taste 3 ³
Inspires new life and spirit, and again

Leads me revived to the gay haunts of men.
In nature's seorets hid, thy birthplaoe lies,
Far seattered, deep, remote from human eyes,
Amid the germs that first gave nature birth,
And the primaeval elements of earth:

Whenoe dared to draw thee to earth’s air-s„ and blend

 

Thy lightsome texture in one glorious end,

Machaon’s raee3 and spread thy wholesome streams
Where’er the sun extends his living beamS.
Aeknowledge God’s good gifts, whose bounteous hand
Aeknowledge all his works through main and land,
Where'er the sun sinks low, or rises high,

The earth, the sea, and the ethereal sky.
