ANTHOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

VIII.
OEo Almam.

IF I had thought thou couldst have died,
I might not weep for thee;

But Ι forgot, when at thy side,
That thou couldst mortal be:

It never through my mind had passed,
The time would e'er be o’er,

And I on thee should look my last,

And thou shouldst smile no more.

And still upon that face I look,
And think ‘t will smile again 3

And still the thought I will not brook‚
That. Ι must look in vain!

But, when I speak‚—-thou dost not say,
What thou ne’er left’st unsaid3

And now I feel, as well I may, Δ
Sweet Maryl thou art dead!

If thou wouldst stay, e'en as thou art,
All cold and all serene,—
I still might press thy silent heart,

And where thy smiles have been!
