ΓΜ wearing awa, J ean,
Like snaw when it’s thaw, J ean 3
I'm wearing awa

To the land o‘ the leal.
There ’s nae sorrow there, J ean,
There ’s nae eauld there, J ean 3
The day is aye fair

In 1116 land o’ the leal.

Ye were aye leal and true, Jean3
Your task’s ended noo, J ean,
And I’ll weleome you

To the land o’ the leal.
