While they drink out of skulls newly torn from the
grave,
Daneing round them pale spectres are seen z
Their liquor is blood, and this horrible stave
They howl :-——-“ To the health of Alonzo the Brave,

And his consort, the False Imogine 1 '’

’Τ Is sweet to hear

 

At midnight on the blue and moonlit deep
The song and oar of Adria’s gondolier,

By distance mellowed, o'er the waters sweep3
’Τ is sweet to see the evening star appear 3

’Τ is sweet to listen as the nightawinds ereep
From leaf to leaf 3 ’t is sweet to view on high

The rainbow, based on ocean, span the sky.

Byron.
