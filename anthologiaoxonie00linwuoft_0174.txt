ANTHOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

Uplifted, and secure with beaked prow

Rode tilting o’er the waves 3 all dwellings else
Flood overwhelmed, and them with all their pomp
Deep under water rolled ς sea covered sea,

Sea without shore3 and in theirpalaoeS,

Where luxury late reigned, sea-monsters whelped
And stabled3 of mankind, so numerous late,

All left, in one small bottom swum imbarked.
Mflton.

LXXXVI.
Qsspitaph.

UNDERNEATH this marble hearse
Lies the subject of all verse ε

¹ Sidney's sister, Pembroke's mother,
Death! ere thou hast slain another,
Fair, and learned, and good as she,

Time shall throw his dart at thee.
