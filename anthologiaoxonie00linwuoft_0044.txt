ANTH OLOGIA OXONI ENSIS.

While e’on thy ehill, bleak eorse I have,
Thou seemest still mine own3
But there I lay thee in thy grave,—

And I am now alone!

I do not think, where’er thou art,
Thou hast forgotten me 3

And I, perhaps, may soothe this heart
In thinking, too, of theess

Yet, there was round thee such a dawn
Of light ne’er seen before,

As fancy never oould have drawn,

And never ean restore.

C. VVoffe.

IX.

from the &tabit

WHEN born, in tears we saw thee drowned,
Whilst* thy assembled friends around
With smiles their joy confest:
So live that in thy latest hour
We may the floods of sorrow pour,

And thou in smiles be drest.

Car-lisle.
