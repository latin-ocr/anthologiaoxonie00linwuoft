XXXIII.

OEbe cettan.

ROLL 011, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll.
Ten thoueand fieets sweep over thee in vain 3
Man marks the earth with ruin 3 his control
Stops with the shore3 'upon the watery plain
The wreeks are all thy deed3 nor doth remain
A shadow of man’s ravage, save his own,
When, for a moment, like a drop of rain,

He siuks into thy depths with bubbling groan,

Without a grave, unknelled, uneoffined, and unknown.
Byron.

XXXIV.

OEbe maiuhnm.

. MY heart leaps up when I behold
A rainbow in the sky!
So was it, when my life began3
So is it now I am a man3
So let it be, when I grow old,
Or let me die,
The child is father of the man,
And I would wish my days to be
Bound eaeh to each by natural piety.
