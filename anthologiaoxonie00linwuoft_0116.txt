HAST thou given the horse strength? hast thou elothed
his neck with thunder?

Canst thou make him afraid as a grashopper? the
glory of his nostrils is terrible.

He paweth in the valley, and. rejoioeth in his strength:
he goeth on to meet the armed men.

He mooketh at fear, and is not affiighted ; . neither
turneth he back from the sword.

The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear
and the shield.

He swalloweth the ground with fiereeness and rage:
neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trum-
pet.

He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he
smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captain8‚

and the shouting.
