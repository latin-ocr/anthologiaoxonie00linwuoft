XX V.

OEu Qualia.

DfflNK to me only with thine eyeS‚
<And I will pledge with mine3

Or leave a kiss but in the cup,
And I’ll not look for wine.

The thirsi: that from the soul doth rise
Doth ask a drink divine3

But, might I of J ove’s nectar sip,

I would not change for thine.

I sent thee late a rosy wreath,

Not so much honoufiing thee,

As giving it· a hope, that there
It might not withered be z 5
But thou thereon didst only breathe,
And sent'st it back to me 3

Sinee when it grows, and smells, Ι swear,

Not of itself, but thee.
Ben Jonson.
