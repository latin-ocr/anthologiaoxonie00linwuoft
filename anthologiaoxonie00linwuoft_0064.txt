GATHER ye rose-buds while ye may,
Old Time is still a—flying3
And this same fiower that smiles to—day,

To-morrow will be dying.

The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,
The higher he's a-getting3
The sooner will his raee be run,

The nearer he's to setting.

That age is best, which is the first,
When youth and blood are warmer3
But being spent, the worse and worst

Times still suceeed the former.

Then be not coy3 but use your time,
And while ye may, go marry3
For having lost but onoe your prime,

You may for ever tarry.

R. Herric .
