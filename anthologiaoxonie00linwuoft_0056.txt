SHE dwelt among the untrodden wayS‚
Beside the springs of Dove 3
A maid whom there were none to praise,

And very few to love.

A violet by a mossy stone
Half-hidden from the eye3
Fair‘as a star when only one

Is shining in the sky.

She lived unknown, and few could know
When Lucy eeased to be 3
And She is in her grave, and oh Ῐ

The differenoe to me!
Wordsworth.

EAKE, τάλαν, ’παρὰ μητρὸς ὃν οὐκ ἔτι μαζὸν ἀμέλξεις,
ἕλκυσον, ὑστάτιον νᾶμα καταφθιμέυης.
ἤδη γὰρ ξιφέεσσι λιπόπνοος, ἀλλὰ τὰ μητρὸς

φίλτρα καὶ εἶν Ἀΐδῃ παιδοκομεῑν ἔμαθον.
