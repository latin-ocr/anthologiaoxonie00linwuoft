ἳΒίῖςε in lepmheline.

ΤΟ fair Fidele’s grassy tomb
Soft maids and village hinds shall bring ,
Eaeh opening sweet of earliest bloom,

And rifle all the breathing spring.

No wailing ghost shall dare appear,
To vex with shrieks this quiet grove3
But shepherd lads assemble here,

And melting virgins own their love.

No withered witeh shall here be seen,
No goblins lead their midnight orew:
The female Fays shall haunt the green,

And dress thy grave with pearly dew-

The red-breast oft at evening hours

’ Shall kindly lend his little aid,

With hoary moss and gathered fiowers
To deek the ground where thou art laid.
