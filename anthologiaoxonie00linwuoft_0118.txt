‘imin habile pou aim.

LIVE while you live, my Boysl
Yet while the lamp doth shine ς
Gather your roses
Ere they decline.

Man makes himself both cares and pains ;
He seeks for thome, and thorns he gains;
But lete, alas! unheeded pass
T he violet in his way!

Live while you live, my Boys ἴ
Yet while the lamp doth shine 3

Gather your roses
Ere they decline.

<2911 a monument in fflteltnsse fflhzy,

EARTH goeth on the earth glistering with gold,
Earth goeth to the earth sooner than it wold3

Earth buildeth on the earth palaees and towerS,
Earth sayeth to the earth, “ All shall be ours.’'
