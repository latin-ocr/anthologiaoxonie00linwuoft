ANTHOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

 

LXXII.

FADE, flowers, fade! Nature will have it s03
’T is but what we must in our autumn do:

And as your leaves lie quiet on the ground,
Their loss by only those that loved them found3
So in the grave as quiet shall We lie,

Missed by some few, that loved our company:
While some so like to thorns and nettles live,

That none for them ean, when they perish‚ grieve.

LXXIII.

&Rhea

WnEN Love With uneonfined wings
Hovers within my gateS,
And my divine Althea brings

To whisper at my grates 3
When I lie tangled in her hair,

And settered to her eye,—
The birds that wanton in the air

Know no such liberty.
