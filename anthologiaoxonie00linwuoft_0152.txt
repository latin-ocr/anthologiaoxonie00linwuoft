126 ΑΝΤ HOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

When flowing oups run swiftly round
With no allaying Thames,

Our careless heads with roses bound,
Our hearts With loyal flames,

When thirsty grief in wine we steep,
When healths and draughts go free,—

Fishes that tipple in the deep
Know no sueh liberty.

When, like committed linnets, I
With shriller throat shall sing

The sweetnesS‚ meroy, majesty,

 

And glories of my King3
When I shall voice aloud how good
He is, how great should be,—
Enlarged winds that ourl the flood
Know no suoh liberty.

Stone walls do not a prison make,

Nor iron bars a oage,

That for a hermitage 3
If I have freedom in my love,
And in my soul am free, -—
Angels alone that soar above

Minds innocent and quiet take
1 Enjoy suoh liberty.
