ἓ Qutnnp.

 

Ο, PARDON 1116, thou piece of bleeding earth,
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man

That ever lived in the tide of times. v

Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy‚—

Which, like (lumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,

 

To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue:
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men3
Domestic fury, and ‘dread civil strife‚

Shall cumber all the parts of Italy :

Blood and destruction shall be so in use,

And dreadful objects so familiar,

That mothers shall but smile‚ When they behold
Their infants quartered With the hands of war ;
All pity choked With custom of fell deeds:

And Caesar’s spirit, ranging for revenge,

With Ate by his side, come hot from 11611,
Shall in these confines, With a monarch's voice,
Cry Havock, and let slip the dogs of war 3
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth

With carrion men, groaning for burial.

S hakspeare.
