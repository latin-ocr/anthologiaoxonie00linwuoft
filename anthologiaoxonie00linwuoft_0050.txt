AN THOLOGIA OXONIENSIS .

 

XII.

 

ALAS 1 they had been friends in youth ;
But whispering tongues ean poison truth3
And constaney dwells in realms above3
And life is thorny 3 and youth is vain3
And to be wroth with one 'we love
Doth work like madness in the brain.
anh spake words of high disdain
And insult to his heart's best brother3 .
They parted— ne'er to meet again!
But never either found another
To free the hollow heart from paining3 --
They stood aloof, the soars remaining,
Like oliffs which had been rent asunder3
A dreary sea now flows between 3—
But neither heat, nor frost, nor thunder,
Shall wholly do away, I ween,
The marks of that which onoe hath been.

Colendge.
