ΤΗΕΥ bid me sleep‚ they bid me pray,

They say my brain is warped and wrung3—
I cannot sleep on Highland brae,

I cannot pray in Highland tongue.
But were Ι now where Allan glides,

Or heard my native Devan's tides,

So sweetly would I rest, and pray
That Heaven would olosemy wintry day!

’T was thus my hair they bade me braid,
They bade me to the ehuroh repair3
It was my bridal morn, they said,
And my true-love would meet me there:
But woe betide the oruel guile
That drowned in blood the morning smile!
And woe betide the fairy dream!

I only waked to sob and soream.
