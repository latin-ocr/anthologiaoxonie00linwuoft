XC.

BEFORE the starry threshold of Jove’s court

My mansion is, where those immortal shapes

Of bright aerial spirits live insphered

In regions mild of ealm and serene air,

Above the smoke and stir of this dim spot,

Which men eall earth3 and, with low-thoughted care,

Confined and pestered in this pinfold here

Strive to keep up a frail and severish being 3

Unmindful of the crown that Virtue giveS‚

After this mortal change, to her true servante,

Amongst the enthron'ed Gods on sainted seatsl
Milton.

XCI.

FEAR no more the heat 0' the sun,
Nor the furious winter's rages;
Thou thy worldly task- hast done,
Home art gone, and ta’en thy wages:
Golden lade and girls all must,

As ehimney-sweepers, come to dust.

Fear no more the frown o' the great,
Thou art past the tyrant’s stroke3
Care no more to clothe, and eat 3
To thee the reed is as the oak :
The sceptre, learning, physic, must
All follow this, and come to dust.
