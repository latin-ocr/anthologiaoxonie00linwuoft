ANTH OLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

 

Some banquet-hall deserted,
WVhose lights are fied,

Whose garlands dead,
And all but he departed 1

Thus in 'she stilly night,

Ere Slumber's chain hath bound me,
Sad Memory brings the light

Of other days around me.

LXIV.

OEhe nying &ohaam

BUT anon her awful jubilant voice,

With a musio strange and manifold,

Flowed forth on a carol free and bold:

As when a mighty people rejoice

With shawms, and with cymbals‚ and harps of gold,
And the tumult of their acolaim is rolled
Through the open gates of the city afar,

To the shepherd who watcheth the evening star.
And the creeping mosses and clambering weedS,
And the willow-branohes hoar and dank,

And the wavy swell of the soughing reedS‚

And the wave—worn horns of the eohoing bank,
And the silvery marish-flowers that throng

The desolate Greeks and pools among,

Were flooded over with eddying song.

Tennyson.
