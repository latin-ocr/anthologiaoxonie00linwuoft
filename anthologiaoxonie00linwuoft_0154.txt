LXXIV.

Qsspitaph in the rzle uf Ἑίἒὲῖίςὼτ.

FORGIVE, blest shade! the tributary tear

 

That 'mourns thy exit from a world like this!
Forgive the wish that would have kept thee here,
And stayed thy progress to the world of bliss 1

ἶ No more oonfined to grovelling soenes of night,
No more a tenant pent in mortal olay 3
Now should we rather hail thy glorious ssight,
And traee thy passage to the realms of day.

LXXV.

Qu Epitapb upon the telsshraten &lemnius qfihilipz,
,immittam mbo him hm} pour.

PHILIPS, whose touch harmonious could remove
The pange of guilty power, and hapless love,
Rest here, distressed by poverty no more 3

Here find that calm thou gavest so oft before ε
Sleep undisturbed within this peaoeful shrine,

’Till angele wake thee with a note like thine-
Gamek.
