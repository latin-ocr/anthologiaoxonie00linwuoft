AN THOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

XXXIX.

OEhe last Aluan.

ALL worldly shapes shall melt in gloom,
The Sun himself must die,

Before this mortal shall assume
Its immortality.

I saw a vision in my sleep,

That gave my spirit strength to sweep
Adown the gulf of Time3

I saw the last of human mould,

That shall Creation’s death behold,

As Adam saw her prime.

The Sun’s eye had a sickly glare,

The earth with age was wan,
The skeletons of nations were

Around that lonely man :
Some had expired in fight, — the brands
Still rusted in their bony hands 3

In plague and famine some.
Earth’s eities had no sound nor tread3
And ships were drifting with the dead

To shores where all was dumb.
