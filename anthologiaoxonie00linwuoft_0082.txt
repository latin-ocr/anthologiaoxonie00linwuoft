56 ANTHOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

Thus while my joyless minutes tedious flow,
With looks demure, and silent paee, a Dun, ’
Horrible monster 1 hated by Gods and men,

To my aerial eitadel aseends.

With voeal heel, thrioe thundering at my gate,
With hideous aceent thrioe he calls, I know
The voice ill-boding‚ and the solemn sound.
What should I do? or whither turn? Amazed,
Confounded, to the dark reeess I fly ¹
Of wood-hole ε straight my bristling hairs erect
Through sudden fem-3 a ehilly sweat bedews
My shuddering limbs, and (wonderful to tell 1)
My tongue forgets her faculty of speeeh3

So horrible he seems l His faded brow
Entrenehed with many a frown, and eonio beard,
And spreading band, admired by modern saints,
Disastrous aets forbode: in his right hand

Long serolls of paper solemnly he waves,

With characters and figures dire inscribed,
Grievous to mortal eyes3 (ye Gods, avert

Sue-h plagues from righteous men 1) Behind him stalks
Another monster not unlike himself,

Sullen of aspect, by the vulgar ealled

A Catehpole, whose polluted hands the Gods
With force ineredible, and magio eharms

Erst have endued: If he his ample palm

Should haply on ill-fated shoulder lay

Of debtor, straight his body, to the touch
Obsequious, (as whilome knights were wont,)
