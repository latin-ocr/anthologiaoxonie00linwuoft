ANTHOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

LX.

melmae.

IF thou wouldst view fair Melrose aright,

Go, visit it by the pale moonlight 3

For the gay beams of lightsome day

Gild, but to flent, the ruins gray.

When the broken arches are blaek in night,
And each shafted orie] glimmers white 3

When the eold light’s uncertain shower
Streams on the ruined eentral tower3

When buttress and buttress, alternately,

Seem framed of ebon and ivory 3

When silver edges the imagery,

And the serolls that teaeh thee to live and die3
When distant Tweed is heard to rave,

And the owlet to hoot o'er the dead man’s grave,
Then go-but go alone the while—

Then view St. David's ruined pile3
And, home returning3 soothly swear

Was never scene so sad and fair.
Scoth.
