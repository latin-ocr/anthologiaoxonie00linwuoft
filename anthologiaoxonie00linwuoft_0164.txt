ANTHOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

‘⁶ For resistance I could sear none,

But with twenty ships had done
that thou, brave and happy Vernon,

Hast achieved with six alone.
Then the bastimentos never

Had our foul dishonour seen,
Nor the sea the sad receiver

Of this gallant train had been.

‘⁶ Thus, like thee, proud Spain dismaying,

And her galleons leading home,
Though condemned for disobeying,
I had met a traitor's doom,
To have fallen, my country crying
⁶ He has played an English part,'
Had been better far than dying
Of a grieved and broken heart.

“ Unrepining at thy glory,

Thy successful arms we hail 3
But remember our sad story,
And let Hosier’s wrongs prevail.
Sent in this foul clime to languish‚
Think what thousands fell in vain,
Wasted with disease and anguish,
Not in glorious battle slain.
