LXXXI.

ᾖσας.

N OT seldom, elothed in saffron vest,
Deceitfully goes forth the morn ;
Not seldom, evening in the west

Sinks smilingly forsworn.

The smoothest seas will ofttimes prove
To the confiding bark untrue:
And if she trust the stars above,

They ean be treacherous too.

The umbrageous oak, in pomp outspread,
Full oft, when storms the welkin rend,
Draws lightning down upon the head

It promised to defend.
Wofflsworth.

LXXXII.
{ines οη some &num that multth οη a 'stahy'z afirmat.

THOSE envious flakes‚ come down in haste
To prove her breast less fair,
Grieving to find themselves surpassed,

Dissolved into a tear.
