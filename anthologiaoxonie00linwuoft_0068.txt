XXIII.
Souna.

COME away, come away, death,
And in sad eypress let me be laid 3
Fly away, fly away, breath3
I am slain by a fair eruel maid.
My shroud of white, stuek all with yew‚
Ο, prepare it ;
My part of death, no one so true
Did share it.

Not a fiower, not a flower sweet,
On my blaek eoffin let there be strown 3
Not a friend, not a friend greet
My poor corpse, where my bones shall be -thrown2 ⁸
A thousand thousand sighs to save,
Lay me, O, where
Sad true lover never find my grave,
To weep there.

Shakspeare.

XXIV.
ffletrartion.

LIE on — while my revenge shall be
To speak the very truth of thee.

Harl Nugent.
