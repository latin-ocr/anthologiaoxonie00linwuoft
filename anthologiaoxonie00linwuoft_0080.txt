ANTHOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

XXXI.

OEhe &plutum ffibissfug,

HAPPY the man, wh0‚ void of cares and strife,
In silken 01· in leathern purse retains

A splendid shilling. He nor hears with pain

Ν ew oysters (nied, nor sighs for eheerful ale:
But with his friendS, when nightly mists arise,
To Juniper's Magpie‚ ,or Town Hall, repairs;
VVhere, mindful of the nymph whose wauton eye
Transfixed his soul, and kindled amorous flameS,
Chloe or Phillis, he, eaeneireling glaSS,

Wishes her health, and joy, and equal love.
Meanwhile he smokes⁵ andlanghs at merry tale,
Or pun ambiguOUS, or eonnnfdxssum quaint.

But I, wllom griping penury surrounds,

And hunger, sure attendant upon want, ,

With scanty offals, and small aeid tiff,
(Wretehed repast Σ) my meagre eorse sustain:
Then eolitary walk‚ 01· doze at home

In garret vile, and with a warming puff

Regale chilled fingere 3 or from tube as black
As winter ehimney, or well polished jet,

Exhale mundungus, ill-perfuming scent.
