“ The history of the lauguage and literature of Greek has so constantly been conflued to the schools of the learned
that notwithstanding the numerous and excellent works extant upon this subject, a work which treats of it in a moro
opular form, suit-ible to the general reader as we 1 as the scholar, has hitherto been a desideratum in out literature.

with this general sketch of a work which, in point ofeopiousness and accuracy of information‚ has few to surpas- it,
while its freedom from all unnecessary display of learning, and its practical and common-sense method of handling

without possessing the advantage cf scholarship, are yet able to sympathise with the interest attaching to the lioenry
development ol* the most accomplished antiquity.” Jonu Dum..
