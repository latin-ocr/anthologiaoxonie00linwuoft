“ And oh ἶ ” he cried‚ “of magic kind
What charms this throne endear?
Some other Love let Venus find,

I’ll fix my empire here.”
Coleridge

XX VIII.

BELIEVE me, if all those endeaiing young charms
Which I gaze on so fondly ‘co-day,

Were to change by to-morrOW, and fleet in my παῖε,
Like fairy gifts fading away 3

Thou wouldst still be adored, as this moment thou art,
Let thy loveliness fade as it will 3

And around the dear ruin each wish cf my heart

Would entwine itself verdantly still.

It is not while beauty and youth are thine own,
And thy cheeks unprofaned by a tear,

That the fervour and saith of a heart can be known,
To which time will but make thee more dear.

Oh! the heart that has truly loved never forgetS,

But as truly loves on to the close 1
As the sun-flower turns on her god, when he sets,

The same look which she turned when he rose.
M ccccc
