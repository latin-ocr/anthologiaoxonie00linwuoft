XXIX.

ZEx ffintbnlngia.

ΕΡΜΟΓΕΝΗ τὸν ἰατρὸν ἰδὼν Διόφαντος ἐν ὕπνοις,

Οὐκ ἔτ’ ἀνηγέρθη καὶ περίαμμα φέρων.

XXX.

antipboluz loquitur.

THERE ’s not a man I meet, but doth salute me
As if Ι were their well—acquainted friend3

And every one doth eall me by my name.

Some tender money to me, some invite me3
Some other give vme thanks for kindnesses;
Some offer me commbdjties to buy:

Ev'n now a tailor called me in his shop‚ Ι

And showed me silke thass he had bought for me,
And, therewithal‚ took measure of my body.
Sure, these are but imaginary wileS,

Ahd Lapland soreerers inhabit here. .

Shakspeare.
