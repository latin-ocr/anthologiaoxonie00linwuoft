CHLORls, yourself you so excel,

When you vouohsafe to breathe my thought,
That, like a spirit, with this spell

Of my own teaehing Ι am caught.

That eagle’s fate and mine are one,
Which on the shaft that made him die
Espied a feather of his own,
Wherewith he wont to soar so high.

'Narcissus’ loud complaints returned,
Not for reflection of his face,
But of his voice, ‘the boy had burned.

Howe'er misfortune seems to lower3
Her smile the threatening tempest oleam,

And is the rainbow of the shower.
