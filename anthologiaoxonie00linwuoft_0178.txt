WHAT is the existence of man’s life
But open war or slumbered strife ⁸?
Where sickness to his sense presente
The combat of the elements,

And never feels a perfect peace,

Till Death’s cold hand. signs his release.

It is a storm —— where the hot blood
Outvies in rage the boiling flood :

And each loud passion of the mind

Is like a furious gust of wind,

Which beats the bark with many a wave
Till he casts anchor in the grave.

It is a flower — which buds and grows,
And withers as the leaves disclose 3
VVhose spring and fall faint seasons keep,
Like fits of waking before sleep,

Then shrinks into that fatal mould

Where its first being was enrolled.

It is a dream — whose seeming truth
Is moralized in age and youth 3
Where all the comforts he can share
Are wandering as his fancies are,
Till in a mist of dark decay

The dreamer vanish quite away.
