ANTHOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

Ι.
OEbz ffiarp.

COME, take thy harp —-'t is vain to muse
Upon the gathering ills we see:

Oh Σ take thy harp and let me lose
All thoughts of ill in hearing thee.

Sing to me, love 1— though death were near,
Thy song could make my soul forget —

N ay, nay, in pity dry that tear,
All may be well, be happy yet.

Let me but see that snowy arm
Once more upon the deal· harp lie 3 μ
And I will cease to dream of harm,

Will smile at fate, while thou art by.
