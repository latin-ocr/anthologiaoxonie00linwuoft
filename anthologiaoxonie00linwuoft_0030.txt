ANTHOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

 

ΙΙ.

Quanam.

WHEN the British warrior-queen,
Bleeding from the Roman rods,
Sougffl, with an indignant mien,

Counsel of her country’s gods 3

Sage beneath the spreading oak
Sat the Druid, hoary ohief 3
Every burning word he spoke

Full of rage, and full of grief.

‘⁶ Prinoess Ῐ if our aged eyes

WVeep upon thy matohless wrongs,

v T is because resentment ties

All the terrors of our tongues

“ Rome shall perish — write that word
In the blood that she has spilt3
Perish, hopeless and abhorred,

Deep in ruins as in guilt.
