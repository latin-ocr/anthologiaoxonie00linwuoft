To Palestine hastened the hero so bold 3
His love she lamented him sore.-

But scarce had a twelvemonth elapsed‚ when behold,

A Baron all covered with jewels and gold ’

Arrived at F air Imogine’s door.

His treasure, his presentS, his spacious domain,
Soon made her untrue to her vows:

He dazzled her eyes; he bewildered her brain3

He caught her affectione so light and so vain,

And carried her home as his spouse.

And now had the marriage been blessed by the priest3
The revelry now was begun:
The tables they groaned with the weight of the feast3

Nor yet had the laughter and merriment ceased,
When the beu Of the casae anea-cmm

Then first with amazement F air Imogine found
That a stranger was placed by her side3

His air was terrific 3 he uttered no sound3

He spoke not, he moved not, he looked not around,

But earnestly gazed on the bride.
