OEhe milling Quaptihe.

YOU gave me last week a young linnet
Shut up in a fine golden eage 3
Yet how sad the poor thing was within it 1

Oh 1 how it did fluiter and rage 1
Then he moped and he pined

That his wings were eonfined,
Til] I opened the door of 1116 den:

Then, so merry was he!
And, because he was free,

He eame to his eage baek again.
