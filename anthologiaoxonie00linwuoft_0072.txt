AS bees

In spring-time, when the Sun with Taurus rides,
Pour forth their populous youth about the hive
In elusters: they among fresh dews and flowers
Fly to and fro, or on the smoothed plank,

The suburb of their straw-built eitadel,

N ew—rubbed with balm, expatiate and confer
Their state affairs. So thick the aery crowd
Swarmed and were straightened 3 till, the signal given,
Behold a wonder 1 They, but now who seemed
In bigness to surpass Earth’s giant sons,

Now less than smallest dwaffs, in narrow room
Throng numberlesS‚ like that Pygmean raee
Beyond the Indian mount 3 or faery elveS,
Whose midnight revels, by a forest side

Or fountain, some belated peasant sees,

Or dreams he seeS, while overhead the Moon

Sits arbitress, and nearer to the earth

Wheels her pale oourse3 they, on their mirth and danee ¹

Intent‚ with jocund music eharm his ear3

At onee with joy and fear his heart rebounds.
Muton.
