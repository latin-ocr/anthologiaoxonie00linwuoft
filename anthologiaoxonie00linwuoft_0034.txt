AN THOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

She, with all a monareh's pride,

Felt them in her bosom glow3
Rushed to battle, fought, and died3
Dying hurled them at her foe.

“ Ruffians, pitiless as proud,
Heaven awards the vengeanee due3
Empire is on us bestowed,

Shame and ruin wait on you.'’
Cowpen

111.

OEbe OEuutse of OEimz.

E'EN such is Time, which takes in trust

¹Our youth, our joys, and all we have,

And pays us nought but age and dust,
Which in the dark and silent grave,

When we have wandered all our wayS,
Shuts up the fable of our days;

And from which earth, and grave, and dust,
The Lord will raise me up I trust.

Su* KNaster Raleigh.
