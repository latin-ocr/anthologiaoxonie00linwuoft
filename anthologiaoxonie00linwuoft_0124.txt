ANTHOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

Shakes the high thieket, haste I all about,

Number my ranke, and visit every sprout
With puissant words, and murmure made to bless.
But else in deep of night, when drowsiness
Hath loeked up mortal sense, then listen I

To the celestial Syrens’ harmony,

That sit upon the nine infolded spheres,

And sing to those that hold the vital shears,
And turn the adamantine spindle round,

On which the fate of gods and men is wound.
Such sweet compulsion doth in musiok lie,

To lull the daughters of Necessity,

And keep unsteady Nature to her law,

And the low world in measured motion draw
After the heavenly tune, which none ean hear

Of human mould, with gross unpurged ear.
Milton.

HN νέος, ἀλλὰ πένης, νῦν (γηρῶν πλούσιός εἰμι·
ὦ μόνος ἐκ πάντων οἰκτρὸς ἐν ἀμφοτέροις·
ὃς τότε μὲν χρῆσθαι δυνάμην, ὁπότ’ οὐδεὲν εἶχον,

νῦν δ’ ὁπότε χρῆσθαι μὴ δύναμαι, τότ’ ἔχω.
