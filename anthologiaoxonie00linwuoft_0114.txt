THE curfew tolls the knell of parting day,
The lowing herd winds slowly oâ€™er the lea,
The ploughman homeward plods his weary way,

And leaves the world to darkness and to me. ,

Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,
And all the air a solemn stillness holds,

Save where the beetle wheels his droning ssight,
And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds:

Save that, from yonder ivy-mantlcd tower,
The moping owl does to the moon complain
Of such as, wandering near her secret bower,

Molest her ancient solitary reign.

Hark! how the sacred calm that breathes around
Bids every fierce tumultuous passion ceasc,
In still small accents whispering from the ground

A grateful earnest of eternal peace.
