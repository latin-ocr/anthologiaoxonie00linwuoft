XXVII.

OEbe moze.

AS late ‚eaeh flower that sweetest blows
I plueked‚ the garden’s pride,

Within the petals of a, rose
A sleeping Love I spied.

Around his brows a beamy wreath
Of rhany a lucent hue 3
All purple glowed his eheek beneath‚

Inebriate with dew.

I softly seized the unguarded Power,
Nor seared his balmy rest,
And placed him, eaged within the flower‚

On spetless Sarah's breast.

But When, unweeting of the guile,
Awoke the prisoner sweet,

He struggled to escape awhile,
And stamped his fairy feet.

Ah Σ soon the seul-entranoing sight
Subdued the impatient boy 3
He gued, he thrilled with deep delight,

Then elapped his wings for joy. -
