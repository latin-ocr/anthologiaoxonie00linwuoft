F ear no more the lightning-flash,
Nor the aH-dreaded thunder-stone 3

Fear not slander‚ censure rash3

Thou hast finished joy and moan.
Shakspeare.

XCII.

I LOVED thee beautiful and kind,
And plighted an eternal vowz
So altered are thy face and mind,

’T were perjury to love thee now.
Earl Nugent.

XCIII.

mimam uf &emunim the OEbehan.

WIND, gentle evergreen, to form a shade
Around the tomb where Sophocles is laid:
Sweet ivy, wind thy boughs to intertwine
With blushing roses and the clustering vine:
Thus will thy lasting leaveS‚ with beauties hung,
Prove grateful emblems of the lays he sung,
Whose soul exalted by the God of wit,

1 Among the Muses and the Graees writ.
