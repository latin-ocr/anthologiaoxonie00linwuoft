ANTIIOLOGIA ‘OXONIENSIS.

XXXVIII.

OEbe 'ssantek

’T IS sung in ancient minstrelsy
That Phoebus wont to wear
The leaves of any pleasant tree
Around his golden hair,
Till Daphne, desperate with pursuit
Of his imperious love,
At her own prayer transformed‚ took root
A laurel in the grove.

Then did the Penitent adorn
His brow with laurel green3
And ’mid his bright looks never shorn
No meaner leaf was seen3
And poets sage, in every age,
About their temples wound
The bay3 and eonquerors thanked the gods
With laurel ohaplets orowned.

Into the mists of fabling time
So far runs baeks the praise

Of beauty, which disdains to olimb
Along forbidden ways 3

That soorns temptation, power defles,
Where mutual love is not3

And to the tomb for reseue flies
When life would be a blot.
