136 ANTHOLOG IA OXONIEN SIS.

‘⁶ Heed, oh heed our fatal story,
I am Hosier's injured ghost,
You who now have purchased glory
At this place where I was lost 1
Tho’ in Porto-Bello’s ruin
You now triumph free from fears,
When you think on our undoing,

You will mix your joy with tears,

‘⁶ See these mournful speotres sweeping

Ghastly o’er this hated wave,

Whose wan oheeks are stained with weeping3
These were English captains brave.

Mark those numbers pale and horrid‚
Those were once my sailors bold 3

Lo Σ each hangs his drooping forehead‚
While his dismal tale is told.

‘⁶ Ι, by twenty sail amended,
Did this Spanish town affright3
Nothing then its wealth defended
But my orders not to fight.
Oh! that in this rolling ocean
I had cast them with disdain,
And obeyed my heart's warm motion

To have quelled the pride of Spain Σ
