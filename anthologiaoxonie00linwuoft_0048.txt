ANTHOLO GIA OXONIENSIS.

XI.

OEu ΑῡῖΙιπεΙΙει.

WHY will Florella, when ῐ gaze,
My ravished eyes reprove 3

And hide from them the only face
They ean behold with love ’.Ρ

To shun her seorn, and ease my care,
I seek a nymph more kind3
And, while I rove from fair to fair,

Still gentler usage find.

But oh! how faint is every joy,
Where nature has no part!

N ew beauties may my eyes employ,

Α But you engage my heart.

So restless exileS, doomed to roam,
Meet pity everywhere3

Yet languish for their native home,
Though death attends them there ἔ
