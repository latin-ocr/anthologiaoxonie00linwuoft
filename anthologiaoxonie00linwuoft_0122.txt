ANTHOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

O’er lawyers’ fingerS, who straight dream on fees:
O’er ladies’ lips, 'who straight on kisses dream:
And sometimes eomes she with a tithe-pig's tail, ,

Tiekling a parson’s nose as ‘a lies asleep.

Shakspeare.

LVII.

aeptztb of the &minz uf the wouh.

FOR know, by lot from Jove, I am the Power
Of this fair wood, and live in oaken bower,

To nurse the saplings tall, and ourl the grove
With ringlets quaint, and wanton windings wove.
And all my plants I save from nightly ill

Of noisome winds, and blasting vapours ehill ε

And from the boughs brush off the evil dew,
And heal the harms of thwarting thunder blue,
Or What the oross dire-looking planet smites,
Or hurtful worm with eankered venom bites.
.When evening gray doth rise, I fetoh my round
Over the mount, and all this hallowed ground 3
And early, ere the odorous breath of morn

Awakes the slumbering leaves, or tasseled horn
