ANTHOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

Tramples on a thousand state

 

“ Rome, for empire far renowned‚

S3

Soon her pride shall kiss the ground -—
Harkl the Gaul is at hor gates 1

“ Other Romans shall arise,

Heedless of a soldier's name3
Sounds, not arms, shall win the

Harmony the path to fame.

“ Thon the progeny that springs

From the forests of our land,

Armed with thunder, clad with

prize‚

wings,

Shall a wider world command.

‘⁶ Regions Caesar never knew

Thy posterity shall sway 3
where his eagles never flew,

N one invincible as they.”

Such the bard's prophetie words,

Pregnant with celestial fire,
Bending as he swept the chords
“ Of his sweet but awful lyre.
