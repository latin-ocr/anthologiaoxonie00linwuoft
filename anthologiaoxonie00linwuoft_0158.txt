LXXVIII.

ΤΗΕ rocks are oloven‚ and through the purple night

I see ears drawn by rainbow-winged steeds

Which trample the dim winds; in each there stands ’ ⁴
A wild-eyed eharioteer urging their ssight:

Some looking back, as fiends pursued them there,

And yet I see no shapes but the keen stars3

Others lean forth, with burning eyeS, and drink

With eager lips the wind of their own speed‚

As if the thing they loved fied on before

And now, even now, they elasped it. Their bright looks

Stream like a eomet’s flashing hair 3 they all

Sweep onward.
