{zabel ann ἷιυτεηᾷο.

FAIR Isabel, poor simple Isabell
Lorenzo, a young palmer in Love’s eye 1
They eould not in 1116 selfsame mansion dwell
Without some 8111· of 116311, 801116 malady 3
They could not sit 31 1116318 1)ι11 feel how well
It soothed each 10 be the other by3
They could 1101, 81116, beneath 1116 831116 roof sleep,
But to 63011 other dream and nightly weep.

With every morn their love grew tenderer,
With every eve deeper and tenderer still 3
He might 1101 111 1101186, field, or garden, stir,
But her full shape would all his seeing fill;
And his continual voice was pleasanter
To her, than noise of trees or hidden rill ,
Her lute-string gave an 60110 of his name,
She spoilt her half-done broidery with the same.

He knew whose gentle hand was at the lateh,
Before the door had given her to his eyes3

And from her chamber window he would catch

“ Her beauty farther than the falcon spies 3

And 0011813111 38 her vespers would he wateh,
Because her face was turned 10 1116 831116 skies 3

And with siok longing 311 1116 night outwear,

To hear her morning step upon the stair.
Keats
