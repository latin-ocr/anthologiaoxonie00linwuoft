ANTHOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

XLI.

Ι FEED the cloudS, the rainbow, and the flowers

With their ethereal colours 3 the moon's globe

And the pure stars in their eternal bowers

Are cinctured with my power, as with a robe3
Whatever lamps on earth and heaven may shine
Are portione of one power, which is mine.

I stand at noon upon the peak of heaven,

Then with unwilling steps I wander down

Into the clouds of the Atlantic even3

For grief that I depart they weep and frown:
What look is more delightful than the smile ’

With which Ι soothe them from the western isle?
Shelley.

TELL me, where is fancy bred,
Or in the heart, or in the head?
How begot‚ how nourishe'd‘?

It is engendered in the eyes,
With gazing fed3 and fancy dies
In the cradle where it lies:
Let us all ring fancy’s knell;
I’ll begin it, ——Ding‚ dong, bell.
Ding, dong, bell.

Shakspoarc.
