LXXXIII.
OEbe lasst {3052 of &muman

’T IS the last rose of summer
Left blooming alone3

All her lovely oompanions
Are faded and gone 3

No flower of her kindred‚
No rose-bud. is nigh,

To refleet back her blusheS‚
Or give sigh for sigh.

I ‘ll not leave thee, thou lone one 1
To pine on the stem3

Since the lovely are sleeping,
Ge, sleep thou with them.

v Thus kindly I seatter

Thy leaves o'er the bed,

XVhere thy mates of the garden
Lie seentless and dead.

So soon may I follow,
When friendships deeay‚
And from Love’s shjning circle
The geme drop away.
When true hearts lie withered,

And fond ones are fiown,
Oh! who would inhabit

This bleak world alone?
