BY foreign hands thy dying eyes were closed,

By foreign hands thy decent limbs composed3

By foreign hands thy humble grave adorned,

By strangers honoured, and by strangers mournedl
What though no friends in sable weeds appear,
Grieve for an hour, perhaps, then mourn a year,
And bear about the mockery of woe

To midnight dances and the public show?

What though no weeping Loves thy ashes grace,
Nor polished marble emulate thy face?

What though no sacred earth allow thee room,
Nor hallowed dirge be muttered o’er thy tomb?
Yet shall thy grave with rising flowers be dressed,
And-the green turf lie lightly on thy breast:
There shall the morn her earliest tears bestow,
There the first roses of the year shall blow 3
While angels with their silver Wings o’ershade

The ground, now sacred by thy relies made.
