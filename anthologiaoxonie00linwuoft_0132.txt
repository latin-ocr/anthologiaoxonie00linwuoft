QBft fn the ειῑιιρ Νῑςψι.

OFT in the stilly night,

Ere Slumber's chain hath bound me,

Sad Memory brings the light
Of other days around me 3
The smiles», the tears,
Of boyhood’s years,
The words of love then spoken3
The eyes that shone,
Now dimmed and gone,

The eheerful hearts now broken 1

Thus in the stilly night,

Ere Slumber’s chain hath bound me,

Sad Memory brings the light
Of other days around me.

When I remember all
The friendS, so linked together,
I’ve seen around me fall,
Like leaves in wintry weather3
I feel like one
Who treads alone
