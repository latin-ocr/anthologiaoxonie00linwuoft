HOW happie was I when I saw her leade

The shepheards’ daughters daunoing in a rownd!
How trimly would she traee and softly tread

The tender grasse, with rosye garland erownd!
And when she list advaunoe her heavenly voyoe,
Both Nymphes and Muses nigh she made astownd,
And floeks and shepheards caused to reioyee.

But now, ye shepheard Lasses ἓ who shall lead
Your wandering troupes, or sing your virelayes?
Or who shall dight your bowres, sith she is dead
That was the lady of your holy-dayes‘?

Let now your blisse be turne'd into bale,

And into plaints convert your ioyous playeS,

And with the same fill every hill and dale.

My little Flock, whom earst I loved so well,

And wont to feed with finest grasse that grew,

Feede ye henoefoorth on bitter astrofell,

And stinking smallage, and unsavorie rew ;

And, when your mawes are with those weeds eor·
rupted,

Be ye the pray of wolves3 ne will I rew

That with your oarkasses wild beasts be glutted.
