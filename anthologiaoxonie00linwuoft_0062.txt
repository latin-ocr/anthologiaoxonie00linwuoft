ANTHOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

XX.

, ¹ OFT in danger, yet alive,

We are come to thirty-five:
Long may better years arrive 1
Better years than thirty-five.
Could philosophers contrive

Life to stop at thirty-five,

Time his hours should never drive
O’er the bounds of thirty-five.
High to soar, and deep to dive,
Nature gives at thirty-five.
LadieS, stoek and tend your hive‚
Trifle not at thirty-five:

For howe’er we boast and strive
Life declines at thirty-five.

He that ever hopes to thrive
Must begin by thirty-five:

And all who wisely wish to wive

Must look on Thrale at thirty-five.
