122 ANTHOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

Though wit may flash from fluent lips, and mirth distract
the breast,

Through midnight hours that yield no more their former
hope of rest3

’Tis but as ivy-leaves around the ruined turret wreath‚

All green and wildly fresh without, but worn and grey
beneath.

Oh could I feel as Ι have felt,—0r be what I have been,

Or weep as I could once have wept, o'er many a vanished
scene 3

As springs in deserts found seem sweet, all braokish
though they be,

So midst the withered waste of life, those tears would

flow to me.
Byron.

As in smooth oil the razor best is whet,
So wit is by politeness sharpest set:
Their want of edge from their offence is seen3

Both pain the least, when exquisitely keen.
Younaeg.
