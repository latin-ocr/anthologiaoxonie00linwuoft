ANTHOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

 

Ne worse to you, my sillie Sheepe! I pray,
Ne sorer vengeanee wish on you to fall
Than to myself, for whose eonfusde decay
To careless Heavens Ι doe daylie call3

But Heavens refuse to heare a wretches ery3
And eruell Death doth seorn to come at eall,

Or graunt his boone that most desires to dye.

For I will Walke this wandring pilgrimage,

,Throughout the world from one to other end,

And in afflietion waste my better age:

My bread shall be the anguish of my mynd,

My drink the teares which fro mine eyes do raine,
My bed the ground that hardest I may fynd3

So will I wilfully increase my paine.

And she, my love that was, my saint that is,

When she beholds from her celestiall throne
(In whieh she ioyeth in eternall bliss)

My bitter penanee, will my ease bemone‚
And pittie me that living thus doo die ;

For heavenly spirits have compassion

On mortall man, and rue their miserie.
