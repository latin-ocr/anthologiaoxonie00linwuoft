ANTHOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

LXVII.

THE sun, that walks his airy way,

To light the world and give the day3
The moon, that shines with borrowed light 3
The stam, that gild the gloomy night ς
The seas, that roll unnumbered waves3
The wood, that spreads its shady leaves:
The field, whose ears conceal the grain,
The yellow treasure of the plain3

All of these, and all I see,

Must be sung, and. sung by me:

They speak their Maker as they can,

But. want and ask the tongue of man, Ι
Parnell.

LXVIII.

een a voluntem ἕοίηρετ.

SWANs sing before they die 3 ’t were no bad thing

Should certain persons die before they sing.
Colerrdge.
