{Bam ants ῆβτεεεηῐ.

THERE's not a joy the world ean give like that it takes
away.

When the glow of early thought declines in feeling’s
dull deoay3

’Tis not on youth’ s smooth oheek the blush alone, which
which fades so fast,

But the tender bloom of heart 1s gone, ere youth itself
be past.

Then the few whose spirits float above the wreek of
happiness

Are driven o'er the shoals of guilt or ocean of excess:

The magnet of their course is gone, or only points in vain

The shore to whioh their shivered sail shall never streteh
agam.

Then the mortal coldness of the soul like death itself
eomes down 3

It cannot feel for others’ woes, it dare not dream its
own3

That heavy ohill has frozen o'er the fountain of our tears,

And though the eye may sparkle still, ’t is where the iee

L appears,
