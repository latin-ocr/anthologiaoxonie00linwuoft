ANTHOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

LXVI.

{Bottia

IS Brutus siok? and is it physioal

To walk unbraezicL and suok up the humours
Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick3
And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,
To dare the vile contagion of the night?

And tempt the rheumy and unpurgiid air

To add unto his siokness‘? No, my Brutus>3
You have some siok offenoe within your mind,
Which, by the right and virtue of my place,

I ought to know of: And, upon my kneeS,

I oharm you, by my once commended beauty,

By all your vows of love, and that great vow

Which did incorporate and make us one,
That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,
Why you are heavy3 and what men ‘co-night
Have had resort to you: for here have been
Some six or seven, who did hide their faces

Even from darkness,

Sha‘kspeare.
